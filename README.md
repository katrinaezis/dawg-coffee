# Responsive Challenge: Dawg Coffee

This folder contains your submission for the [responsive challenge](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/responsive). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. What is the URL of this site, as hosted on your student webserver (i.e., students.washington.edu/<code>{uw-new-id}</code>/info343/<code>{project-name}</code>) #####
> http://students.washington.edu/kezis/info343/dawg-coffee/

##### 2. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> No

##### 3. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> I tried, but I'm sick and tired. So no.

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> Too many. Maybe 10? I had a lot of small stupid details that I couldn't get just right. Like some white space on the side of my page, or a nav-bar with the wrong coloring. All of these issues took a lot of time to identify the cause of and even more time to fix.

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> A lot of the directions were unclear. They were formatted in a way that made me want to achieve a pixel perfect replication of the given screen-shots, but not detailed enough to achieve this. Also the bits about the copying the svg image from the file was very unclear. I kept trying to simply utilize the svg like an img, but ran into many issues. Also we didn't have very much time between the last assignment and this one, whereas this one took a lot of work.
